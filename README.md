# BinPacking
Some experimentation with bin packing algorithms. Current script only works in 2D using a rectangular bin packed with square boxes. Currently code is a proof of concept for simple case. 
## Goals
- [ ] Implement code in 3d
- [ ] Generate N packed bins efficiently through dynamic algorithm
- [ ] Use rectangles (in 2d) and rectangular prisms (in 3d) with rotations

## To Do
- Add command line and configuration file parsing
- Add classes for bin, items to add
- Optimize some functions by implementing priority queues
- Consider 2d case with Rectangles and rotations.
- Redo draw function (currently a quick patch for quick visualization)
- Implement testing for functions
